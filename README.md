[Link to assignment](https://gist.github.com/joeldavidw/f9766a91d9b3bd0a4f226f52a4a6674e)

## Accomplishments

- Created 6 working endponts that returns valid blocks/blockchains, verified via e2e tests
- Utilised DAG to determine best chain and non-best chain blocks
- Implemented and verified the robustness of Indexer features: state persistence, block invalidation, and seamless continuation from service downtime
- Set up continuous integration to automate project building and testing on push to Github with Github Workflows
- Utilized Docker to ensure standardized builds across multiple environments
- Created unit tests for BlockchainFetcher module

## Suggestions for improvements

Perhaps a more relaxed deadline

## Reflections

Overall, this was a fun project. I was definitely pushed out of my comfort zone as I had to dabble with unfamiliar tools (nest.js, jest), implement unfamilar features (cacheing), and revisit unfamiliar concepts (unit testing, mocking, monkey patching, CI, OOP etc.). 10/10 would do again.
